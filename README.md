Various time series analysis techniques are used and the best model for predicting the number of refugees for the coming days is selected. In addition, our forecasting model also answers the following research questions:

Q1: What is the preferred destination for the refugees affected by the change in the total number of refugees on the Western-Balkan route?

Q2: To what extent are both time series related?

We would like to examine the correlation between the countries.
For example, the detailed explanation would be that if there is a correlation between "Arrivals on the Greek island" and "Mainland Greece" during a certain period of time, then the same correlation would exist in the future.


### About the Data:
The dataset contains information on the refugees arriving in various European countries such as Serbia, Italy, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Greece and the Greek islands. Dataset counts the numbers of refugees from October 2015 to September
Both of these can be used to create a forecasting model to predict the influx of refugees into a particular country.
